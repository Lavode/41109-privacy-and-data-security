# Anonymousc communication

- Goal: Hiding sender identity among group of possible senders
- The mere possession of tools (e.g. having Tor installed) will limit the
  anonymity set
- Our networks need meta-data (e.g. personalized addresses). Not a proper
  broadcast network!

## Terminology

- Sender nodes: Nodes sending messages
    -> Initiations
- Receiver nodes: Nodes receiving messages
    -> Targets
- Communication nodes: Nodes forwarding messages

Goal:
- Senders want to stay anonymous among all senders
- Recipients want to stay anonymous among all recipients

Either for:
- Datagrams (single messages)
- Circuits (bi-directional communications)

## Assumptions

- Network participants are honest-but-curious. Stick to the protocol, e.g.
  forwarding messages, but try to learn as much as possible while doing so.
  - Global observer sees all messages on network
- Each node only sees messages it receives or sends (no broadcast)
- Messages carry source and destination

- Anonymity means that a node is one of many nodes among an anonymity set.

## Anonymity of a message

```
Property                             | ... against node(s) ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sender-anonymity                     | receiver / some nodes / global observer
Receiver-anonymity                   | sender / some nodes / global observer
Unlinkability of sender and receiver | some nodes / global observer
```

- Unlinkability: Unable to establish which two parties are communicating

### Example: Forward proxy / VPN

Sender sends all traffic to proxy, which forwards to recipient.

- Provides sender-anonymity against receiver (but not against network)
- And no receiver-anonymity (unless it's a reverse proxy)
- Unlinkability against global observer (assuming sufficiently little meta
  data, e.g. timing information, leaked)

#### Assumptions

- Ignoring timings, size of transmitted data,

## Crowds

- Early research prototype

Model:
- Set of communication nodes (includes senders) = Crowd
- Set of receivers

- To send message, send message to oneself
- When any message received, with probability `p` forward directly to
  recipient, with `1 - p` to another member of the crowd
- Requires a membership service, that is a way to look up members of the crowd
- Nodes keep track of which messages (unique ID) they received from who
  Ensures that backward direction can be made to work

### Properties

- Sender anonymity
  - Against receiver: Excellent
  - Against some nodes: Partial
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: None
- Receiver anonymity: None
- Unlinkability:
  - Against some nodes: Yes
  - Against all nodes: Partial
  - Against global observer: None

## Onion routing

TOR: The Onion Router

- Practical, connection-oriented routing protocol
- Low latency

### TOR network

- Uses source routing (source determines routing path), chosen by sender
  - Sender chooses three random nodes of TOR network
  - Routing information is encrypted with nodes' keys, so e.g 1st node only
    learns 2nd node but not 3rd or destination
- Each onion router (OR) maintains a point-to-point encrypted long-lived
  connection to all other onion routers
- Traffic among OR consist only of fixed-size 'cells' (prevent leak of meta
  information)
- Membership (directory) service allows nodes to find each other
- Client (sender) connects via (local) onion proxy (OP)

### Onion routes

- Each OP communicates via a circuit (onion connection)
  - Can rotate it periodically. Lifetime of minutes (e.g. 10)
- Route through the network
- Carries multiple types of traffic (HTTPs, SSH, ...)

### Route setup

- Sender OP picks a random route of length l through network (l = 3)
- Source routing

[FIXME, missing key negotation]

### Onion communication protocol

- Sender (OP) encrypts message `m` as:
  `c = Enk_K1(
        Enc_K2(
          Enc_K3(m, destination), 
          RP3
        ),
        OR2
      )`
- Every OR (node `k`) operates as follows:
  - `(c', OR_{k+1}) = Dec_k(c)`
  - Sends `c'` to `OR_{k+1}`
- Exit nodes send `m` to `destination`
- Reverse direction follows inverse operations, with nodes keeping required
  state

### Today

- Ca 7000 OR nodes
- Millions of users (probably distinct onion clients connecting to proxies)

### Security

- Each `OR_k` sees encrypted traffic from some random `OR_{k-1}` to `OR_{k+1}`
- Exit node `OR_l` for one circuit sees all traffic:
  - Receiver
  - Content
  - Correlations

### Properties

- Sender anonymity
  - Against receiver: Excellent
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: None (worst case, if no traffic)

- Receiver anonymity: 
  - Against sender: None (on purpose, sender knows who it's talking to after all)
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: None

- Unlinkability:
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: None

### Remaining information leaks

- Metadata (timing, traffic shape, ...)
- DNS (better than it used to be)
- Exit nodes

Possible improvements:
- Fixed timings by e.g. only forwarding data once a second
- Permute packets before sending
- All costs efficiency
