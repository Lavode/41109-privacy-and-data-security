# Pseudonymization

Recall GDPR:
- Personal data; personally identifiable
- Pseudonymous data: Can not be linked to data subject, unless if additional
  information (e.g. mapping person to pseudonym) known.
  Done by replacing PII with pseudonyms.
- Anonymous data: Can no longer be linked to data subject.

## Pseudonymization method

- Preserve some structure and utility of data set
  - E.g. if wanting to reuse real-world data in test envvironment
  - Or giving data to ML people
  - Or protect against legal attacks
- Don't change format of data
- Want cryptographic guarantees

Various methods, from simple to complex:

### Encrypt whole dataset

- Good for privacy
- But encrypted dataset has no utility

### Table lookup

- Random lookup table stored in secure place
- Preserves utility
- Preserves structure
- Preserves format (if table chosen format-compliant)
- Reversible
- Downside: Must store lookup table, rather than only key as with cryptographic
  methods

### One-way tokenization

- E.g. by means of a PRF, HMAC-style construction, more generally
  collision-free function
  - Keyed or unkeyed

- Preserves utility
- Preserves structure (referential integrity)
- May or may not preserve the format
  - Problem: Hash of credit card number is bit sequence. Want to represent this
    as something which *looks* like a credit card number again.
- But cannot be reserved


### Reversible tokenization

- Using symmetric encryption

- Preserves utility (if made deterministic!)
- May or may not preserve format (by default will just output bit sequence)
- Does not protect against legal attacks

## Security model

Trusted world:
  Dataset:
    - Table
    - Fields

  Tokenisation:
    - By means of the above
    - Keyed or unkeyed

Untrusted world:
  Pseudonymized dataset:
    - Preserving utility/structure/format/... dependant on the type of
      pseudonymization used

## Irreversible tokenization

### Hash function

```
H : {0, 1}^* -> {0, 1}^k
```

Maps arbitrarily long bitstrings to `k`-bit strings, with these days usually `k
> 256`.

#### Security guarantees

- Collision resistance: Infeasible to find x, x' such that H(x) = H(x')
- First preimage resistance: Given H(x), infeasible to find x
- Second preimage resistance: Given x, infeasible to find x' such that H(x) = H(x')

### Hash-based tokenization

```
Dataset           Pseudonyms
x     -- H -->    t
```

### Pseudorandom function

```
F: {0, 1}^lambda * {0, 1}^m -> {0, 1}^k
//  Key k           Input       Output
```

#### Security

- Without access to key, F behaves like a one-way function
- And it cannot be distinguished (in polynomial time) from a proper random map

Implementation using:
- MAC (e.g. HMAC)
- Block cipher (then it will even be a PRP, as reversible)

## Format-preserving encryption

- Problem: Database fields (e.g. CC numbers) have structure
  - Not arbitrar binary sequences
  - Probably limited to printable characters
  - Or subset thereof
  - Contain checksums
  - ...
- Bit strings can easily be converted to e.g. sequence of integers
  - But might not be perfect replication of format

Formally:
- Given possible outputs of crypto primitive as T
- And set of (format-compatible!) values field can take as M
- With M subset of T

### Cycle-walking algorithm

Given crypto primitive:
```
F : T -> T
```
- Where F is collision-free
- With `|T| = O(|M|)`
  - Otherwise reduce each element of T, by cutting off trailing bits

Then:
```
// Gets original input (eg CC card), outputs random (but different!) network
map(F, s):
  t <- s // s in M
  repeat:
    t <- F(t)
  until t in M

  return t

// Tries to get original input back from mapped output
unmap(F_inv, t):
  s <- t
  repeat:
    s <- F_inv(s)
  until s in M:

  return s
```

### Reversible tokenization

How to encrypt on a small domain?
- Typically, block ciphers use 128-bit strings
- Need a PRP (because invertible) on a much smaller `T = {0, 1, ..., N - 1}`

### Feistel Encryption

NB: This is an example of an *unbalanced* Feistel cipher

- Use `a, b \in N` with `a * b >= N`, and `T = {0, 1, ..., N - 1}`
- PRF `B : K * {0, 1}^* -> {0, 1}^k`

```
FE-Enc(z, a, b, m):
  // z in K key
  // m in T message

  // Split m into two pieces
  L_0 = m div b
  R_0 = m mod b

  for i = 1 .. rounds, do: // rounds >= 3
    if i odd:
      s <- a
    else:
      s <- b

    L_i = R_{i - 1} XOR
    R_i = (L_{i - 1} XOR B(z, i || R_{i-1})) mod s

  return s * L_{rounds} + R_{rounds} // in {0, 1, ... a * b - 1}
```

- Format-preserving encryption uses algorithms `FE-ENC` and `cycle-walking`
