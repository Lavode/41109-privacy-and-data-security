# Tracking

- Tracking ubiquituous, lead to 'surveillance economy'
- Big companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, ...) in the business
- Profit per user 10 - 70 USD / year. (Mind: E.g. Apple also sells hardware,
  Amazon services)
- Pure data companies (Google, Facebook): 10 - 15 USD / user / year

## Prelude: Intel's unique serial numbers

- Intel press release: CPUs have unique serial number, accessible via dedicated
  CPU instruction.
- Allows tracking unique identity of platform
- Big debate followed, focused on 'privacy'
- Intel retracted plans / made feature optional, off by default

- Modern Intel: Heavy investment into privacy by means of e.g. hardware
  modules: TPMs etc

## Today

- Many different unique identifier, e.g. fingerprints based on OS, browsers,
  ... profile

## Active tracking

- Client (e.g. browser) *does* part of the tracking, and can also detect it

### Cookies

- Cookies add state to stateless HTTP, needed for continuity and sessions
- Text-based key/value store
- Site x can store cookie, which is then automatically supplied with subsequent
  requests to x by browser
- 1st party cookies: Set by site x for site x, needed for continuity. 
- 3rd party cookies: If site x includes some content from site y (e.g. facebook
  like button), that content can set a cookie for site y as the client will
  issue a request to y to load the content. Mostly used for tracking.

#### Chrome starting to block cookies

- Chrome will block 3rd party cookies by 2022

### Tracking pixels

- Typically 1x1 transparent images included from external site
- Cause request to 3rd-party site, allow tracking akin to e.g. FB like button
- Or just plainly allow to track e.g. opening of mail

### Identifiers built-in on devices

- Mobile: IMSI, phone number, GAID (google advertisement ID), IDFA (ID for
  advertisers, Apple, opt-in since 2020)
- Desktop: Not common, as software less tightly controlled. But recall Intell
  DAA/EPID. And OS and software likely to phone home regularly.

### Evercookie

- Using *other* methods for storage (!= cookie) in browsers, store identifiers
  in there. Allows recreation of tracking cookies with persistent ID on every
  visit.
Using:
- Flash (historic, deprecated)
- HTML5 local storage
- ETags
- ...

### Server-sided cookie synchronization

- Sites each send unique cookie
- But also exchange this information with each other, allowing to correlate
  them
- Domain A sets cookie, and makes browser include some personalized content
  (e.g. tracking pixel) from site B
- Domain B then able to associate that same user with its own identifier
  (cookie)
- And the two sites can correlated their identifiers via the shared resource
  which was included

## Passive tracking

- Client takes no action, trackers not visible to client
- Fingerprinting

### Browser fingerprinting (mostly desktop)

- Browsers expose a lot of information, e.g. viewport size
  - (Partially) required for operations
- List of fonts (highly unique, as likely constantly growing over lifetime of
  device)
- Canvas rendering
- Installed browser plugins
- Device audio devices and features (e.g. supported codecs)
- WebRTC (reveals e.g local IP, and local characteristics)
- Battery API (2012 - 2016): Reveals information about battery charge, model,
  make, ...
  - Studies showed that users acted differently (e.g. shopping behaviour) based
    on battery level

### Device fingerprinting (mostly mobile)

Some features make it harder, some easier, to track on mobile compared to
desktop.

- Compared to desktop, users usually have no direct control over OS
  - Harder: Makes some parts of tracking harder, defaults might be sensible
  - Easier:But some also easier, user cannot harden system
- Easier: Default browsers (e.g. android web view) have little customization
  (e.g. OS patch level included in browser user agent)
- Easier: Many identifiers available
- Harder: Vendors (slowly) allow hiding of identifiers, due to tracking being subject
  of public discourse
- Harder: Devices are fairly homogenous, making it harder

- Can also be used for fraud prevention: Detect intercepted sessions, new
  clients, track malicious clients, ...
