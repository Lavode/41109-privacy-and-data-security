# 9.4 Mix networks

- Ideal, but theoretical, design
- Used as component of higher-level designs (e.g. voting protocols)

## Model

- Many senders
- Many receivers
  - Each with public key
- `n` communication nodes ('mixers') in a sequence

- Sender encrypts message with pk of receiver and with pk of 1st mixer
- 1st mixer waits until it has `m` messages, shuffles them, then forwards to 2nd mixer
- And so on
- Last mixer posts encrypted message to public bulletin board
- Receivers actively poll messages, see if they can decrypt any
  - NB the have to poll all (or at least many) messages, so they won't reveal
    which ones are for them
  - Will work if e.g. known structure in plaintext (think magic bytes), or
    authenticated encryption, etc
- Max size of message
- Works only on datagrams

## Protocol

```
1) Sender
Pad m to max length
Sender S encrypts m to R as c := Enk(pk_R, m)
Send c encrypted with key of mix_1 to mix_1

2) Mix protocol
mix_i receives from mix_{i-1}
Decrypts message, waits until m messages accumulated, permutes randomly
Re-encrypts with key of mix_{i+1}, sends all to mix_{i+1}

3) Publishing
Last mixer receives messages, decrypts them
Posts all (still encrypted with pk of R) to bulleting board

4) Receiver
Pulls all messages from board, checks if any decrypt
```

Two layers of encryption are required to ensure that c cannot be traced through
the network.

## Variations

- Add randomized delays
- Add dummy traffic

## Properties

- Sender anonymity
  - Against receiver: Excellent
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: Excellent

- Receiver anonymity: 
  - Against sender: Excellent
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: Excellent

- Unlinkability:
  - Against some (l - 1) nodes: Excellent
  - Against all nodes: None
  - Against global observer: Excellent

## Problems

- Limited capacity
- Only for specialized tasks (e.g. inside voting systems)
- No robustness: Malicious nodes can not forward messages, or not shuffle them
  properly

NB: As described, receiver-encrypted ciphertext is visible to `mix_1`, along
with identity of sender.
Potential fix: Onion-style encryption, then intermediary encryption between
mixers not required.

# 9.5 Dining cryptographers and untraceable communication

- Cryptographers at dinner table
- Anonymous donor pays bill
- Goal: Find out if it was someone sitting at the table, or an outsider,
  without leaking who specifically

- Protocol for `P = {P_1, ..., P_n}`
- Each `P_i` inputs one bit `x_i`, `1` if they paid, `0` if not
- Goal: Compute `s = XOR x_i`
  - Assume at most one paid, that is we calculate `XOR x_i`, not `OR x_i`

Notation: All indices assumed to be `mod n`

Note: This is simply one instance of MPC, where we calculate the (X)OR.

## Algorithm

```
for i = 1 to n:
  P_i: Choose k_i <- {0, 1}
  P_i: Shares k_i with P_{i+1}
  
for i = 1 to n:
  P_i: announces publically y_i := k_i XOR k_{i-1} XOR x_i

Everyone computes:
  s := XOR y_i
```

## Completness

```
s = XOR y_i
  = XOR k_i XOR k_{i-1} XOR x_i
  # Every k_i appears twice
  = XOR x_i
  = s
```

## Security

- Given any connected set `C` of colluding nodes
- Graph `(P, E)` is the key structure
- Remove `C` from graph: `(A, F) = (P \ C, E \ {{u, v} \in E, u \in C OR v \in C})`
- Reduced graph is new anonymity set
- That is colluders learn that one node in A paid

# 9.6 Freenet

Anonymous censorship-resistant publishing.

So far: Communication, ie send-receive
Now: Data storage, ie read-write or CRUD (without delete in case of Freenet)

## Design

- P2P system: Every node stores some data for itself, some for others
- Nodes communicate with 'friends', instances known to the node
- All data is stored encrypted and identified by 'keys'
- Nodes do not know what data they store, which grants them deniability

### CHK

- Content-addressable storage: Address of file (used to request it) is defined
  as hash of plaintext file.
- Content-Hash-Key CHK of file: `CHK(f) := H(f)` for some cryptographic hash
  function `H`

- File content additionally encrypted using `k_file`, a key derived from a
  description (think filename) of the file

- Reference to file is then `(chk_file, k_file)`

### Naming and name spaces

- Keyword-signed key KSK for a file, derived deterministically from a 'name' or
  'keyword', is an asymmetric keypair
  - Everyone can create file with certain 'name'
  - Everyoe can retrieve friles from 'name'

- Signed-subspace key SSK
  - Implements a namespace **under a specific user's key**
  - User `A` with public key `pk_A` creates SSK for a file, identified by
    'name' as:
    ```
    seed := H(pk_A || name)
    Create public/private keypair from seed
    // Probably signs it?
    Uses this as "key for file" (ie KSK?)
    ```
  - Only user A can insert files under its namespace
  - User A publishes `pk_A` and name:
    - Anyone with this knowledge can retrieve file

- Files are stored in 32kB chunks and adddressed indirectly
- Files are also signed under the file's key and subspace key to prevent
  tampering

### Storage and retrieval protocol

- Every node stores files addressed by keys
- Every node keeps a routing table
  - For various keys, list of nodes we think might have those keys

To access a file:
- Repeatedly ask neigbhours, updating routing table, until we find node storing
  given key
- 'Similar' keys are stored by same nodes
  - So if we do not know where a key is stored, we can send the request to
    nodes known to store similar keys
- When a node has the file it sends it back along same path
  - Intermediary nodes through which response flows store copies of it
  - When data not requested for a long time, it can be overwritten by new
    incoming files

=> File data is propagated towards nodes requesting it.
=> File data is lost if not accessed
