# Introduction

- Focus on privacy and anonymity rather than security

# Privacy

Goal: Definition using contextual integrity (CI).

Desired attributes:
- Privacy concerns information about individuals or groups of people
- Privacy is about the ability of an individual to be hidden, or of hiding its
  information
- Privacy allows to selectively release information, coupled to a purpose
- Societal norms, technology, laws and regulation influence each other, as well
  as privacy

## Incomplete notions of privacy

- Privacy means that no information flows to third parties
  - Yet some information flow is usually desired, if not required, for a
    service
- Split data into public and private
  - Such a split can not be done without context
- Privacy is the right to control all one's information
  - Yet certain information (e.g. tax declaration) has to be released

=> Context is essential for defining privacy.

## Context

Definition:
- A social domain, setting or interaction in which information is transferred.

Examples:
- University (exam vs lecture vs breakroom vs ...)
- Family
- Health care
- ...

Context characterized by elements:
- People
- Relationships
- Values, traditions
- Purpose and goals
- Time and place
- Laws

## Informational norm

Definition:
- Characterized by five elements
- Aka an information flow, defined by:
  - Sender, recipient, subject (= actors)
  - Information type (= attributes)
  - Transmission principle ('reason' that information was transmitted, e.g.
    willingly, stolen, enforced license, ...)

## Privacy defined via contextual integrity

An information flow respects the informational norm of the context.
