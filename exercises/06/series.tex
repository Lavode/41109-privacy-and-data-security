\section{\emph{k}-anonymity and \emph{l}-diversity}

Let $A$ be a dataset sanitized with discrete \emph{l}-diversity. Then, every
equivalence class $C$ contains at least $l$ distinct combinations of sensitive
attributes. As such $C$ contains at least $l$ rows, and hence has
\emph{l}-anonymity.

Similarly let $A$ be a dataset sanitized with probabilistic \emph{l}-diversity.
Then for every equivalence class $C$, every combination of secret attributes
$(s1, \ldots, s_n)$ contained in $C$ makes up at most $\frac{1}{l}$ of the
equivalence class. The smallest possible equivalence class $C$ will thus have
$l$ combinations of different sensitive information, each making up
$\frac{1}{l}$ of the equivalence class. As such it has distinct
\emph{l}-diversity, and hence also \emph{l}-anonymity.

\section{Implementing \emph{k}-anonymity with the Mondrian algorithm}

\subsection{NCP as a fucntion of \emph{k}-anonymity}

The provided implementation of the Mondrian algorithm was used to sanitze the
sample dataset to various levels of \emph{k}-anonymity. The achieved ``NCP''
--- a measure in the range of $[0, 1]$ of how generalized the data is ---
plotted versus the $k$ parameter is shown in figure \ref{fig:k_anonymity_ncp}.

\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{resources/k_anonymity_ncp.png}
		\caption{NCP as a function of \emph{k}-anonymity}
		\label{fig:k_anonymity_ncp}
\end{figure}

As expected the degree of generalization which has to be utilized goes up the
higher $k$ is. For \emph{3}-anonymity it is around \SI{20}{\percent}, for
\emph{5}-anonymity around \SI{30}{\percent}, for \emph{10}-anonymity around
\SI{50}{\percent} and for \emph{74}-anonymity --- $74$ being the size of the
full dataset --- as expected \SI{100}{\percent}.

No meaningful difference is visible between strict and relaxed mode of the
Mondrian algorithm.

\subsection{Improving the algorithm with randomization}

As the algorithm is greedy, its outcome will be influenced by the ordering of
data. As such it can be optimized by running it multiple times over
permutations of the input data, keeping the \emph{k}-anonymization with the
lowest NCP value.

As the provided implementation is a mess, with global state preventing
successful subsequent executions of the algorithm, this was measured by means
of a separte Python program which invokes the anonymizer multiple times in
sequence, shuffling its input file inbetween invocations.

Figure \ref{fig:k_anonymity_ncp_randomized} shows that, with 100 attempts each,
marginally lower NCP values can be achieved --- albeit at the cost of
significantly increasing the time anonymization takes. Improvements are usually
in the range of \SIrange{2}{5}{\percent}.
