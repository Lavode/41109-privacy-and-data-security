# 10.1 Irreversible tokenization

The attached code implements irreversible tokenization using the
cycle-walking algorithm, both using plain SHA256 as well as
HMAC-SHA256.

## a) Implement luhn() method

The `luhn()` method can be found in `util.py`.
The Luhn checksum digit is assumed to be in the last position, but as long as
the position is known, its location is irrelevant. Removing it and calculating
the Luhn checksum over the remaining number will work in any case.

## b) Unkeyed irreversible tokenization

Irreversible tokenization using cycle-walking with SHA252 can be found in
`irreversible_tokenization.py`, in the `hash_token` method.

## c) Kyed irreversible tokenization

Irreversible tokenization using cycle-walking with HMAC_SHA252 can be found in
`irreversible_tokenization.py`, in the `mac_token` method.
