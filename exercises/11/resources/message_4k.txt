          PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2

Abstract

   This document provides recommendations for the implementation of
   public-key cryptography based on the RSA algorithm, covering
   cryptographic primitives, encryption schemes, signature schemes with
   appendix, and ASN.1 syntax for representing keys and for identifying
   the schemes.

   This document represents a republication of PKCS #1 v2.2 from RSA
   Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series.  By
   publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF.

   This document also obsoletes RFC 3447.
